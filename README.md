# README

Basic guide for all contributions:

Don't ask for permission, ask for forgiveness - Based on the proposal assignment, fb chat is pretty slow for all of us to come to a concensus, so just msg everyone on fb what you're beginning to work on, and then create a branch for it. Ask Edward for help with git, and he'll teach you the magic of git or something: https://xkcd.com/1597/

Don't repeat yourself - Pretty much, think about wrapping your logic in functions whenever possible, it's amazing how simple this can make things. 

Document your code - If you're writing a function, please provide a brief, but understandable overview of what it's manipulating. If you're writing an object, please provide a brief, but understandable overview of what it represents to the code base. This is super crucial, since some of us have lots of knowledge of algorithms, but are weak on networking, and vice versa. Plus, we won't all be able to pair program this thing, so documentation as we go will be important, so that if someone gets sick, someone else can take over. Edward will be eternally grateful!
